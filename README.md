# EcoRE - The Ecosphere Runtime Environment

This is *EcoRE*, my little programming language playground that I've been working on in my spare time since 2020.

It acts as a virtual machine and runtime environment for my programming language *Eco*, which is a language inspired by [Self](https://selflanguage.org/).
